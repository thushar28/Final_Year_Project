# Cataract_Detection_Using_Machine_Learning
##### Cataract is a progressive eye disorder that leads to visual impairment and blindness if left untreated. Detection of cataract is crucial for prompt intervention and management.The project deals with such a system, which uses deep learning algorithms to analyze images of the patient's eyes and identify the cataracts. The algorithms are trained on datasets of fundus images.
##### The current work for cataract detection using DenseNet has achieved a binary accuracy of 94% and a validation  binary accuracy of 93%, indicating its effectiveness in detecting cataract in the given dataset.
