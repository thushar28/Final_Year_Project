# Cataract_Detection_Using_Machine_Learning
#### Cataract is a progressive eye disorder that leads to visual impairment and blindness if left untreated. Detection of cataract is crucial for prompt intervention and management.The project deals with such a system, which uses deep learning algorithms to analyze images of the patient's eyes and identify the cataracts. The algorithms are trained on datasets of fundus images
